                <h2>3D Printing Overview:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Workflow</strong>: The process begins with 3D modeling, followed by G-code generation,
                        bed preparation (which includes leveling and calibration), material selection, and finally the
                        printing process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software and Tools</strong>: Recommended 3D modeling software includes SolidWorks and
                        Blender, with STL as the export format. G-code generation is tailored to the printer model, with
                        PrusaSlicer and Bambu Studio being the primary tools for Prusa and Bambu printers respectively.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Preparation and Monitoring</strong>: Thorough bed cleaning and application of a fresh
                        adhesive layer are crucial for good print quality. Continuous monitoring, especially during the
                        initial minutes of printing, is essential to mitigate any early issues.</li>

                    <div class="row uniform">
                        <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="christmas.png" alt="" /></span>

                <h2>Soft TPU Material Printing:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Material Characteristics</strong>: Soft TPU is valued for its flexibility and
                        durability, suitable for applications like soft robotic fingers. It requires specific settings
                        for temperature, flow rate, print speed, and retraction to manage its elastic nature
                        effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Printer Setup</strong>: Optimal printing of TPU involves starting with lower temperature
                        settings to avoid issues like stringing, adjusting flow rates to ensure proper extrusion, and
                        using a direct drive extruder for better control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong>: Common issues with TPU include stringing, poor layer
                        adhesion, and moisture absorption which can affect print quality. Solutions involve adjusting
                        temperature, print speed, and ensuring the filament is dry.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Personal Reflections on 3D Printing</h2>
                <p>
                    3D printing stands as a transformative technology that merges the boundaries of imagination and
                    reality. It offers an unprecedented flexibility and fidelity in creating complex structures which
                    were once deemed impossible. My journey into 3D printing has been driven by a passion to explore its
                    potential in robotics and material science, particularly with the use of innovative materials like
                    soft TPU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This technology not only enhances our capabilities in prototyping and production but also challenges
                    us to rethink design and manufacturing processes in an eco-friendly and efficient manner. Each layer
                    printed adds to our understanding and capabilities, pushing the envelope of what's possible both in
                    academic research and real-world applications.
