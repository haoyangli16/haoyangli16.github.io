## About Me

My name is Haoyang (Harris) Li, and I am a Research Scientist in the [Department of Computer Science
and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), where I am advised by
[Prof. Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/). I obtained my bachelor's degree in
Intelligent Manufacturingâ€”an interdisciplinary major combining mechanics and computer
science-from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). I have also had
the opportunity to work with [Prof. Rui Chen](https://callmeray.github.io/homepage/Home.html)
at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and focused on
UAV research in the [Vision4Robotics Group](https://vision4robotics.github.io/).
During my undergraduate years, I engaged in college entrepreneurship, starting an initiative
focused on healthcare robotics.
