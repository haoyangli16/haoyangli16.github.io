## About Me

Hi!üëã My name is Harry Li, and I am a Research Scientist in the [Department of Computer Science
and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), where I am advised by
[Prof. Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/). I obtained my bachelor's degree in
Intelligent Manufacturing from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). I also contributed to robot development and embodied AI research at startup [Hillbot](https://www.hillbot.ai/) as the **1st Intern**.
<!-- 
‚Äîan interdisciplinary major combining mechanics and computer
science-from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/). I have also had
the opportunity to work with [Prof. Rui Chen](https://callmeray.github.io/homepage/Home.html)
at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and focused on
UAV research in the [Vision4Robotics Group](https://vision4robotics.github.io/). -->
During my undergraduate years, I also led an entrepreneurial initiative focused on healthcare robotics (see [here](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-02/02/c_139715877.htm)) üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
