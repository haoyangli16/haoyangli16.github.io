supervision . The robot  (Fig. 1 (a)), which  offers  9-DOF,  has a 
compact  design  consisting  of a positioning  unit (Fig. 1 (b)), a 
support  unit (Fig. 1 (c)), an information  processing  unit (Fig. 1 
(d)), a puncturing  unit (Fig. 1 (e)) and a needle  module  (Fig. 1 
(f)). As shown  in Fig. 2, This robot  uses a vascular  localization  
technology  that combines  a NIR camera  and anultrasound  
device  (st-1c transducer,  frequency  7.5MHz,  48 lateral  array  
elements,  80 axial  array  elements,  element  spacing  0.3mm) 
which  is placed  at the front  of the robot . In the longitudinal  
section  of blood  vessels,  ultrasonic  images  are used to perform  
vein segmentation  and estimation  of vein depth . The NIR 
optical  imaging  is used to segment  the venous  distribution  in 
the horizontal  direction .
    The positioning  unit, with its 4-DOF,  consists  of motor  and 
ball screw  drive  modules . Three  of them  are translations  along  
the x, y, and z axis, while  the fourth  is rotation  along  the z axis. A Portable Robotic Device for Autonomous 
Vascular Access
performed  daily . The procedure  is traditionally  guided  by 
visual  inspection  and palpation  of the peripheral  forearm  veins . 
Once  a suitable  vein is located,  a needle  is then inserted  into 
the center  of the vessel . Oftentimes,  however,  it is difficult  to 
estimate  the depth  of the vein or steer the needle  if the vein 
moves  or rolls. Poorly  introduced  needles  may then result  in 
complications  such as increased  pain,  internal  bleeding,  or 
extravasation . The challenges  of venipuncture  are exacerbated  
in obese  and dark-skinned  patients  where  locating  a vein can 
be difficult,  as well as in pediatric  and geriatric  populations  
where  the veins  are often  small  and weak .
    Unlike  imaging -based  methods,  which  rely on manual  
insertion,  robotic  strategies  could  altogether  eliminate  the 
dependence  on practitioner  experience  and availability . Here,  
we present  a portable  venipuncture  robot  capable  of steering  
needles  and catheters  into submilli -meter  vessels  with minimalenipuncture  is critical  to a plethora  of clinical  
interventions  and is the most  ubiquitous  invasive  
routine  in the U.S., with over 2.7 million  procedures V

Motors  1, 2, and 3 operate  jointly  to move  to the target  x-y 
plane  obtained  by analyzing  the NIR images  using  the NIR 
algorithm . The puncture  angle  is determined  by motor  4. At 
the same  time,  the cantilever  mechanism  moves  down  as a 
whole  to ensure  that the ultrasonic  equipment  touches  the skin 
correctly  so that a clear  ultrasound  image  can be collected  and 
used for pre-puncture  navigation . Upon  contact  with the skin,  
it can elicit  high-quality  longitudinal  vein section  images,  the 
ultrasonic  algorithm  then calculates  the depth  of the puncture  
point . The puncturing  unit has 2-DOF,  is driven  by a uni-axial  
mechanism,  and can puncture  under  the guidance  of an 
ultrasonic  device . The movement  of the needle  along  the y-
direction  is controlled  by motor  5 in the puncturing  unit, while  
motor  6 advances  the needle  module  to the vein puncture  point .
Transmission  part
    The transmission  part of the mechanical  mechanism  is a six-
degree -of-freedom  compact  mechanism  (Fig. 4(a)) designed  
with a reliable  short  transmission  chain  structure,  which  
mostly  consists  of a precision  ball screw  and Maxon  motor  
(Fig. 4(b)).
    Low friction  in ball screws  yields  high mechanical  
efficiency  compared  to alternatives . A typical  ball screw  may 
be 90 percent  efficient,  versus  20 to 25 percent  efficiency  of 
an Acme  lead screw  of equal  size. Lack  of sliding  friction  
between  the nut and screw  lends  itself  to an extended  lifespan  
of the screw  assembly,  reducing  downtime  for maintenance  
and parts  replacement,  while  also decreasing  demand  for 
lubrication . In the meanwhile,  the key features  that set 
Maxon’s  electronically  commutated  EC motors  apart  are their 
excellent  torque  performance,  high power,  extremely  wide  
speed  range,  and unrivaled  service  life. The outstanding  
controllability  of the motors  permits  the creation  of high-
precision  positioning  drives .
    Consequently  thus,  the transmission  part with  the 
advantages  of high  axial  stiffness  of ball screw,  high transmission  accuracy,  high mechanical  efficiency,  etc., 
guarantee  the positioning  accuracy  of Needle  Module  and the 
stability  of puncture  process . 
3-DOF  Needle  Module
    As shown  in Fig. 5, the 3-DOF  Needle  Module  consists  of 
a linear  stage  driven  by a lead screw  spindle  supported  by ball 
sliders  and a worm  drive  system .
    The new kinematic  geometry  allows  puncture  needle  the 
insertion  angle  to be controlled  independently  of the other   
DOF . A worm  drive  system  (C in Fig. 5) is used to control  theFig. 3. Hardware  and software  system  architecture  design,  depicting  the process  flow from  image  acquisition,  signal  processing,  and robotic  controls .

insertion  angle  to ensure  self-locking  of the rotational  joint. 
This prevents  free, unconstrained  motion  by the robot  when  
electrical  power  is not being  supplied  to the system . This 
design  is key to providing  the needle  to adjust  the insertion  
angle  to the optimal  puncture  angle  without  increasing  the 
device  size. Two ball screw  mechanisms(A,  and B in Fig. 5) 
are used to push the puncture  needle  into the blood  vessel  step 
by step according  to the position  specified  by the control  
system . This design  can accurately  adjust  the puncture  speed  
of the needle  during  a puncture . This design  also changes  
dramatically  improves  the puncture  stability  and needle  tip 
positioning  accuracy  of the robot .
Coordinate  Transformation
    After  obtaining  the ultrasonic  image  of the target  vein,  the 
transformation  between  the image  frame,  the camera  frame,  
and the world  frame  is needed  to accurately  map the puncture  
point  coordinates  in the image  to the robot  execution  
coordinates  (Fig. 6). The relationship  between  the pixel  unit 
coordinates  of any point 𝑢 ,𝑣in the image  (𝛤) and its 
corresponding  millimeter  unit coordinates  (𝑋,𝑌)satisfies  the 
following  homogeneous  transformation  matrix  𝑇.
    Furthermore,  from  the representation  of world  coordinate  
system  (𝑂𝑤𝑋𝑤𝑌𝑤𝑍𝑤) in the camera  coordinate  system  (𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑧 ), 
the relationship  between  the world  coordinate  system  
(𝑥𝑤,𝑦𝑤,𝑧𝑤)and the camera  coordinate  system (𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)is 
obtained :
    In the equation  above,  𝑀𝑤 is the external  parameter  matrix  
of camera ; [𝑛𝑥,𝑛𝑦,𝑛𝑧]𝑇 is the direction  vector  of 𝑋𝑊 in 𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑧 ; 
[𝑜𝑥,𝑜𝑦,𝑜𝑧]𝑇 is the direction  vector  of 𝑌𝑊 in 𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑧 ; 
[𝑎𝑥,𝑎𝑦,𝑎𝑧]𝑇 is the direction  vector  of 𝑍𝑊 in 𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑧 ;  
[𝑝𝑥,𝑝𝑦,𝑝𝑧]𝑇 is the of f se t  vec tor  of 𝑂𝑊 in 𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑧 .Motor  Control  System
    As depicted  in Fig. 7, the motor  control  scheme  is as 
follows . First,  the 3-D coordinates  of the selected  target  vein 
center  are outputted  from  the NIR and the US vein 
segmentation  algorithm  and inputted  into the inverse  
kinematic  equations . Here,  the joint parameters  needed  to 
position  the needle  at the desired  location  before  the 
cannulation  are calculated . The manipulator  can dynamically  
steer the needle  in real-time by tracking  the injection  site and 
vein walls  in the US image  to account  for patient  arm 
movement,  tissue  deformation,   and vein rolling .
    Our proposed  deep learning  network,  allows  us to 
continuously  feedback  on the updated  desired  injection  site 
extracted  from  the US image . In this fashion,  the US serves  as 
image  feedback  to guide  the needle  manipulator  in a closed -
form  control  loop. Here,  the cannula  is steered  into the vein 
until the needle  tip reaches  the center . By tracking  the target  
vessel  in real-time throughout  the insertion,  the device  can 
compensate  for rolling  veins,  tissue  motion,  and the 
viscoelastic  nature  of human  tissue .

Motors)  for each joint were  utilized,  which  contain  both motor  
drivers  and encoder  counters  on the same  board . We operated  
them  using  a controller  area network  protocol  to send 32-bit 
PWM  signals  (100-kHz switching  frequency)  to the motors .
Near -infrared
    We randomly  select  six NIR images  as examples  and show  
the vein segmentation  and suitable  puncture  areas  in Fig. 8. 
We propose  a Dual -In-Dual -Out network  with two-step 
learning  and two-task learning  to determine  the suitable  
puncture  area and angle  from  the NIR image  inputs . A visual
illustration  of the proposed  network  is shown  in Fig. 9. It 
contains  two steps  of training : first, it trains  a Single -In-
Single -Out network  to segment  the vein from  the NIR image ; 
second,  it inputs  both the NIR image  and vein segmentation  
from  the first step training  into the Dual -In-Dual -Out network  
to regress  the suitable  puncture  area and angle .Five examples  of the suitable  puncture  area regression  by the 
four methods  are shown  in Fig. 10. We can visually  see that 
both the Dual -In-Single -Out and Dual -In-Dual -Out network  
can distinguish  between  the suitable  and non-suitable  puncture  
area better  than the Single -In-Single -Out and Single -In-Dual -
Out network,  indicating  the importance  and value  of bringing  
the vein segmentation  into the network’s  input . For the 
regression  of suitable  puncture  areas  and angle,  The mean  and 
std DSC  are shown  in Table  Ⅰ and Table  Ⅱ.

Medical Image Segmentation

good  performance  in image  segmentation . To merge  the 
advantages  of these  deep-learning  neural  networks,  our model  
integrates  multiple  image  segmentation  networks . Through  
stacking  methods  and feature  image  coding,  we propose  the 
Integrated  Segmentation  Model  (ISM),  offering  high precision  
for vein segmentation  from  ultrasonic  images . As shown  in 
Fig. 12, the overall  structure  of ISM includes  two layers . The 
first layer  is composed  of three  sub-models  (FPN,  PSPNet , and 
UNet , numbered  as models  1, 2, and 3). The output  result  
diagram  of the first layer  was used as the input  training  picture  
of the second  layer . The second  layer  of the sub-model  is 
composed  of LinkNet , which  takes  the label  picture  (GT)  of 
the original  data set as the recognition  target .
    As can be seen in Table  II, the proposed  ISM demonstrates  
its superiority  over traditional  models  in terms  of the three  
indicators,  namely  Dice-Similarity -Coefficient  (DSC),  
Hausdorff -Distance  (HD95) and Intersection -Over -Union  
(IOU) . The ISM model  achieved  significant  improvements  in 
multiple  indicators : its DSC  value  increased  by about  6 %, 
reaching  94.62 %, and the IOU value  increased  by about  11%, 
in complex  samples . Finally,  a clear  puncture  point  is 
calculated  through  the connection  domain  algorithm . 
Experimentally,  the success  rate of selecting  the suitable  vein 
for puncture  is 99.21%.Fig. 11. Eight  examples  of ultrasonic  angiography  (top)  with their

To make  the robot  more  reasonable,  we adopt  the most  
relaxed  lancing  posture  of human  limbs  (adult  standard)  
through  ergonomic  measurement  and calculation(Fig .15).
    The portable  Venipuncture  Robot  we invented  has a size of 
0.376*0.253*0.298 𝑚3, which  greatly  reduces  the volume  
compared  with similar  robots  in 1*1*1.5 𝑚3. At the same  time,  
using  POM  mixed  materials,  the mass  of our robot  is in the 
range  of 6kg, about  15% of similar  robots,  making  it more  
portable .Fig. 15. Design dimensions and usage scenarios
To validate  the assembly  accuracy  and stability  of the 
automatic  venipuncture  robot,  we carried  out experiments  
multiple  times  to test its positioning  error . Different  sizes  of 
circles  on the printed  paper  were  used to simulate  blood  
vessels  of different  sizes  (with  diameters  ranging  from  3-5mm). 
The center  of the circle  was set as the puncture  target  point,  
and the distance  from  the center  of the puncture  point  was 
taken  as the measurement  standard  of puncture  accuracy . We 
use a marker  instead  of a needle  to mark  puncture  points  on 
paper . The simulated  puncture  results  are shown  in Fig. 16 (a) 
(marked  points  in the red circle) . After  10 groups  of tests,  we 
collected  and analyzed  the data, the result  is shown  in Fig. 16 
(b).
    It was determined  that the maximum  puncture  error  of the 
puncture  robot  was 1.79mm and the minimum  error  was 
0.91mm. At the same  time,  according  to the principle  that if 
the final point’s  position  drawn  by the pencil  falls within  the 
radius,  it is recognized  as a successful  puncture,  otherwise,  it 
fails,  the success  rate of the test was 98.24%.Of course,  it is more  valuable  for the specific  populations,  
such as elder  people,  infants,  or people  with shock  state. For 
instance,  some  elderly  patients  need long-term puncture,  thus 
may causing  hematoma,  phlebitis,  artery  or nerve  damage  due 
to repeated  puncture,  and the robot  can find more  puncture  
sites and perform  more  precise  puncture,  which  can effectively  
reduce  the pain of patients .
    The robot  can not only  walk  into the hospital,  the 
community,  but also walk  into the home,  applied  in the 
laboratory . Because  of its high degree  of automation,  simple  
and easy to operate,  operators  do not need  professional  
medical  knowledge,  it can be convenient  to provide  puncture  
services . At the same  time,  it has obvious  advantages  inErgonomic Design

Application and Prospect
Through  mathematical  modeling  and the puncture  
experiments,  the venipuncture  robot  can effectively  relieve  the 
working  pressure  of medical  staff,  and at the same  time,  
reduce  the risk of cross -infection  among  medical  staff in the 
context  of the COVID -19 pandemic .
